# Ocki

Tap on any adjacent blocks of the same type to make them all disappear.
Clear larger sets for more points. That's it.

## About
This particular implementation of Ocki was built for my mother
since she loved an old version we had on an ancient computer that no longer ran on "real" computers. 
Since then, I've remade this game a few times. I don't know how long the last version I made will run as we leap into the future, so I took the opportunity to explore PixiJS and build something new.

The code is rough, and the polish is uneven, but I hope you enjoy this as much I did making it!

## Credits
All of the art has been inexperly drawn by myself as an exercise in getting familiar with vector art.

[Bubblet](https://www.oopdreams.com/win/bubblets/) was the first version of this game I'm aware of.

I've borrowed heavily from [PixiJS' OpenGames](https://github.com/pixijs/open-games) to structure Ocki.

The font [LilitaOne](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lilita+One) is by Juan Montoreano.

And of course all the bugs, mistakes, and other short comings are purely my own!
